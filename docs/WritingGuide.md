# Writing Guide for Specifications

This document specifies how specification documents should be written.

## Wordings

### Use of "shall"

Although [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) specifies that the
word ***SHALL*** has the same meaning as the word ***MUST***, we advice using
the word ***MUST*** (or prehaps ***REQUIRED***) than using ***SHALL***.
